<p>You have been hired by the Altgeld Dairy Queen to paint an advertisement on the main quad sidewalk. The area that needs to be painted is a row of tiles numbered $1$ through $n$; each tile will be painted exactly one color. You must paint these tiles in order starting from Tile $1$. (Painting out of order would result in stepping on wet paint.) The set of possible colors is $\{1,\dots,C\}$.</p>
<p>You are provided an array $Color[1..n]$, where $Color[i] \in \{1,\dots,C\}$ is the color that the Altgeld DQ has requested for Tile $i$. However, changing colors while painting is time consuming because it requires completely cleaning off the paint brush and paint tray. Thus, you wants to minimize the number of times that you have to change colors. You can get away with painting some tiles incorrectly, but if you make too many mistakes, then you will be fired. In particular, if more than $m$ of the tiles are not the correct color, then the Altgeld DQ will fire you.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of times that you have to change colors to prevent getting fired?</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
Consider the input $Color = [1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1]$:
<ul>
<li>If $m = 0$, then the minimum number of color changes is 4.</li>
<li>If $m = 1$, then the minimum number of color changes is 2, which can be achieved by incorrectly painting Tile 4 with Color 3.</li>
<li>If $m = 3$, then the minimum number of color changes is 0, which can be achieved by painting all of the tiles with Color 1.</li>
</ul>
