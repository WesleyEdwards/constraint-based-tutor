Reflection:

What were the benefits of using a context free grammar for your task domain?
My example was very very general, but I feel that this could be very beneficial for musicians.
There are some subtle but VERY important dos and don'ts that novice musicians don't really understand.
If you're playing at a jazz gig, you should definitely not play autumn leaves as a tango, and although
the sax solo in "In the mood" was originally improvised, you really need to play the solo in the Glenn Miller 
recording. These things are very important to big jazz fans, and by using a context free grammar, we can
make sure novices can learn these rules and not make fools of themselves.

What were the down sides or difficulties of using a context free grammar for your task domain?
A lot of the possibilities are obviously non-viable, and would never be used. If we were to build out more
of these questions in this domain, we'd probably wan to make sure they don't come across as silly.

What were the benefits of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?
I feel like it's easier to give the user some direction, and gives them some things to think about and consider.
Not only does it help them choose right answers, but it helps them consider the possibilities by
just seeing the different possibilities.

What were the down sides or difficulties of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?
It's just a little difficult to think of and list all the possible constraints. If I you're not careful when
constructing it, you could easily give a false positive as feedback, and that would be a little awkward
if we were to encourage some un-acceptable behavior.
